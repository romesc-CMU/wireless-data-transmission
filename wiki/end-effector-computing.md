### Print Settings

- We used Solidworks to design and test assembly fit for each part.
- We printed the model with [Ultimaker 2+](https://ultimaker.com/) and [Creator Pro](http://www.flashforge.com/creator-pro-3d-printer/). The settings used are listed below:
    - Layer height: 0.1 mm
    - Infill Percentage: 50%
    - Temperature: 225¬∞C

> - Alternatively, [Shapeways](www.shapeways.com) supplies high quality 3D print services.

- The final printed models:

## Mounting the enclosure to the robot arm

![mount step 1](./img/mount_1_1.jpg)

![mount step 1](./img/mount_1_ink.jpg)

1. Connect the enclosure body [#3.1] and the end-effector cuff connector [#3.4] with 2X screws [#5.3]

![mount step 2](./img/mount_2_ink.jpg)

2. Unscrew the Kinova Jaco's last joint's top three screws. And directly secure the assembled parts (enclosure body + cuff connector) to the arm with 3X screw [#5.3]



<a id="org6f79684"></a>

## Fitting the hardware to the 3D enclosure

### Insert the Joule into the enclosure

![mount step 3](./img/mount_3_ink.jpg)

-  Secure the Intel Joule board [#1] into the enclosure with 4 X Screws [#5.1].

> Please make sure the two wifi antenna would not touch each other and able to be fit in the enclosure.

### Attach camera to the enclosure

Camera Mount 1

![Picture of attaching camera position 1](./img/flat_mount.jpg)

Camera Mount 2

![Picture of attaching camera position 2](./img/incline_mount.jpg)

1. Install flat front camera mount:

    5.1 Mount the Intel RealSense camera with 2 X screw [#5.2]. 

    > Make sure the camera is securely mounted with the enclosure, which would not resulting much vibration when the end effector's moving

    ![mount step camera](./img/mount_4_ink.jpg)

    5.2 Connect camera and the Intel Joule with USB type C to A 3.0 cable [#2.1]

    ![mount step camera](./img/mount_5.jpg)

    5.3 Secure the flat enclosure top with 4X screws [#5.2]

2. (Optional) Install incline camera mount:

    6.1 Secure the incline enclosure top with 4X screws [#5.2]

    6.2 Mount the camera on the enclosure with 1X screws [#5.4].

    > Make sure the camera is securely mounted with the enclosure, which would not resulting much vibration when the end effector's moving

    6.3 Connect camera and the Intel Joule with USB type C to A 3.0 cable [#2.1]

## Thermal mitigation

Parts[#8]

-   ![Picture of cooler](./img/cooling.png)

You may purchase the part from this [site](https://store.gumstix.com/fansink-intel.html). 

The problem we encoutered was that the Joule would automatically shutdown due to the high temperatures. The passive cooling option is not a sufficient cooling option when the camera is running. With active cooling, we were able to run the camera at full FPS indefinitely without issue.

![active_cooling](img/active_cooling.PNG)

> When installing this module, you need to take off the four screws which directly on the CPU module. Please remove them carefully and screw them securely with the active cooling module. And please use the thermal paste sticker when connect the heat sink with the CPU.

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Electrical


<a id="org7981dc9"></a>

## üîå Recommended power source

-   Intel Joule with Intel RealSense D435 running requires ‚â• 1.5A @ 12V
> ‚ùóÔ∏èIntel joule only requires ~0.6A @ 12V to boot.
-   Kinova Mico Joint 6 supplies max 3A @ 24V
-   Inside the hand, there is limited space to store the power conversion circuit. We use buck convertor from Pololu [#4] to convert the power from Kinova arm to supply intel Joule.

 We drilled a hole from the hand for the DC jack to go through.

# Software

<a id="orgcbfb208"></a>

## Installing the OS to the Joule

- Please check [this post](./Intel-Joule-Setup.md) to install the OS onto the Intel Joule.
- In my project, I used Lubuntu (Ubuntu/Linux core 16.03 LTS) with ROS-Desktop version installed. 


<a id="org4290339"></a>

## Installing Required Libraries

- [ROS required packages (with minor modifications)](https://github.com/ramonidea/prl_wireless_perception.git)

    - [ROS Image Transport Plugins](https://github.com/ros-perception/image_transport_plugins.git)

    We used Compressed Image Transport Plugins to compressed the RGB Images. 

    - [ROS Image Pipeline](https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline.git)

    We used one function `point_cloud_xyzrgb` inside the `depth_image_proc` to reconstruct the point cloud data from RGB and Depth images.

    > And their dependency packages `image_common` and `image_geometry`

    - [RGBD_Message](https://github.com/ramonidea/prl_wireless_perception/tree/master/rgbd_message)
        
        This is a custom package trying to solve the problem that depth and color images are not arriving at the same time. This send a message with serialized rgb and depth image data. And we used JPEG lossy compression on Color and lossless compression on Depth.

- [Realsense Camera Driver](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense)

    Please follow the [README document](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/readme.md) to install the driver.

- [RealSense Camera ROS Wrapper](https://github.com/intel-ros/realsense)

    Please build this after installing the driver.

## Networking Diagram

![Optiuon 1](./img/option_1.PNG)

Option 1

This option is mainly rely on Python codec and ROS realsense wrapper. It compresses RGB and Depth into one serialized array topic with custom message type: `/camera/rgbd`. And the client side run the decompress methods to separate the one topic into two topics: `/camera/color/decompressed` and `/camera/depth/decompressed`, or it may use the decompression pacakge, which you can call the decompress function in your client side and decompress into two frames without republishing.



![Option 2](./img/option_2.PNG)

Option 2

This option is mainly rely on C++ and ROS realsense wrapper. It compresses RGB and Depth image separately into two topics: `/camera/color/image_raw/compressed` and `/camera/depth/image_raw/compressedDepth`. And the client side may use `Message_filter` to synchronize those two topics.

# Recommended Networking Configuration

![Networking](img/networking.PNG)

<a id="org06cd64d"></a>

## Client-side (off-board computing) Networking

-   We are currently using [#10] TP-Link Router. 
-   We set the static IP addresses for both the client side and the server side. 

> For example, you may set the client side to be static as 192.168.2.171. And the joule be 192.168.2.176.

We will run the roscore on the client side. 

<a id="orgc67814a"></a>

## Server-side (end-effector computing) Networking

-   Because we run the rerscore on the client side, please use command to set `ROS_MASTER_URI` and `ROS_IP` on each machine.


<a id="orge867589"></a>

## ROS

-   use command `ifconfig` to retrieve the IP address from your workstation. 

> The ip addresses should be always the same, because we save the ip address in the router setting from the last step.

-  Please make sure the Joule's `ROS_MASTER_URI` has been set to that ip address. And set the `ROS_IP` correctly. 


    As an example, if your workstation (ip address `192.168.1.10`) running `roscore` has a wireless adapter IP of `192.168.1.12`, then make sure your terminal running the ROS environment has its `ROS_MASTER_URI` pointed to the workstation like so: `export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.10:11311` and set joule ip address with command: `export ROS_IP=192.168.1.12`
